If you have any questions or suggestions, do not hesitate to create a new issue.
I'd be happy to hear your thoughts.


### Attention please :warning:

Feature requests or issues can be written in different languages besides
English. Because we have lots of users from many countries that can't speak
English well enough. So it's best to have no restriction on languages. Our
primary concern is how do you use your language and that's it. If you like to
post anything, please choose your words carefully and create clean, elegant,
and smooth sentences in your language and try to provide more details as much as
you can so that readers can understand your words by translating them with a
Translator app or etc.

Thanks in advance!
