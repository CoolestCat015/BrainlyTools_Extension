If you have any questions or suggestions, please create a new issue. I'd be
happy to hear your thoughts.


### Attention please :warning:

Feature requests or issues can be written in different languages besides
English. Because we have lots of users from many countries that can't speak
English well enough. So it's best to have no restriction about languages. Our
only concern is how do you use your language and that's it. If you like to post
anything, please choose your words carefully and create, clean, elegant, and
smooth sentences in your language and try to explain as much as you can so that
we can understand by translating your words via Google Translate.

Thanks in advance!

Sahin D.
